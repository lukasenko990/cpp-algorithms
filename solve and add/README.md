# Solving and adding problems
This algorithm takes t number that is the number of cases. Each case contains n number which is number of problems to solve and m number which is number of available methods of solving the problem. Each method contains x number which is number of problems that can be solved by using this method and y number which is number of new problems that are created using this method. For each case program display minimum number of methods that cause that number t is equal or less than zero. If none of methods is solving more problems than adding new problems program displays "BRAK METOD" which means "NO METHODS".
